With this SBA, I am creating an application where the parents fill out their kids information and with that information, the application tells them how much they need to invest or put away to help with the kid's college education. 
Objectives:
Use DOM properties, methods, and techniques to create a web application that provides a dynamic user experience.
Use BOM properties, methods, and techniques to facilitate creation of a dynamic web application.
Demonstrate proficiency with event-driven programming and DOM events.
Implement basic form validation using any combination of built-in HTML validation attributes and DOM-event-driven JavaScript validation.
